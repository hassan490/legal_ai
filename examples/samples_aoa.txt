Subject: Proposal to Change Registered Office Address
Ahmed,
As discussed informally, Blue Crescent recommends relocating the Company’s registered office to a more cost-effective business center.
Proposed new address:
Unit 903, Aurora Business Centre,
Al Quoz 3, Dubai, UAE.
Please confirm if you agree so we can formalize this by board approval and proceed with DET filings.
Best regards,
Laura
